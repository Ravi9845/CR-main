 Create a public hosted zone in the AWS account where your target host or website is located. The hosted zone name should be your desired subdomain (e.g., comm.test.com).
2.    Copy the NS (Name Server) records generated for this hosted zone to a notepad.
3.    Switch to the AWS account where the testdev.com domain is managed (Account #123).
4.    In this account, navigate to the Route 53 service and locate the testdev.com domain.
5.    Within the testdev.com domain settings, click on "Create record".
6.    For the new record:
o    Choose "Record Type: Name Server Records (NS)"
o    Set the record name to your subdomain (e.g., comm.testdev.com)
7.    In the "Value" field, paste the NS records you copied in step 2.
8.    Save the new record.
9.    Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
10.    To verify the resolution:
•    Return to the AWS account where you created the hosted zone (from step 1)
•    Create a CNAME record in this hosted zone
•    The CNAME record should be for a specific tenant, e.g., tenant1.comm.testdev.com
•    Point the CNAME record to your desired resource (e.g., a load balancer)
11.    After allowing some time for DNS propagation (typically 5-30 minutes):
•    On your local computer, open Git Bash or Command Prompt
•    Run the command: nslookup tenant1.comm.testdev.com
(Replace 'tenant1.comm' with your actual tenant and subdomain)
This process will delegate the DNS management of your subdomain to the public hosted zone in the other AWS account, allow you to create tenant-specific records, and verify that the setup is working correctly.
